  upgradeDescription: You set up clear guidelines and rules that maintain a sense
    of respect for your students. This upgrade helps you create a well-structured
    environment where expectations are understood, and boundaries are respected,
    but it doesn't cross into harshness. Students know when they need to focus, and
    they feel safe under the predictable structure you've set. However, over-relying
    on this method may lead to increased tension, especially if too much rigidity
    is enforced.
